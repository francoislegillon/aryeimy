# Monarch asset placeholders

This directory intentionally ships with lightweight SVG placeholders so the repository stays binary-light. Replace the SVG files
with production-ready APNG/GIF/PNG overlays and add a real fallback video before publishing. Keep the file names consistent with
`manifest.json` or update the manifest accordingly.
